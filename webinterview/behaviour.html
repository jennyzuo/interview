Be prepared for a lot of behavioral questions: "tell me a time when...."
- you disagreed with your manager
- you did something innovative
- you helped a peer
- you had to deal with a tight deadline and couldn't deliver in time
They want to know what you would have done differently and what you learned.
These are really important, try to come up with different examples every time and to be prepared 
because these questions are probably more difficult than the technical ones and after 4 hours 
it's hard to answer at your best.  


How would you build a sharable form validation component ? Show the HTML and JS.

How would you implement document.querySelectorAll manually using recursion?  

Was asked to do make a pyramid of an array of numbers using for loops.

Given a JSON object, build a page of items from that JSON that meets specific design parameters 
(4 items per row, color of title, border, margins, padding all according to spec). 
The spec was ugly, IMO, but whatever... I was given the design specs and was not interviewing 
as a designer, but as a developer. Requirements included fading images in/out on mouseover, 
delete an item from the list, undo a deletion, etc.
Additional features included sprite display from an Amazon-provided spritesheet 
for showing the number of stars on reviews

Describe the box model. Create a drop down menu using jQuery.  

When I click to this button I want it moves down 200px.  

How do you detect for the first repeated character in a string? How do you detect whether or not a word is a palindrome?  

Writing the code for a game that entailed an array of numbers and finding the fastest way to get to the end when the numbers were the number of steps you could move forward, and if you hit a zero, the game was over.  

How would you stop a cross-site request attack?   save a token in a cookie

1)write a plugin like query on the paper
2)write a data structure queue program in javascript on the paper
3)given 2 objects 
var obj1 = {
  name: "abc";
};
var obj2 = {
  age: 25
};

do the interitance;

4)lets have ()[]{} pattern should have open and close inorder;
example a{abc()}[]//write a funtion to return true;
example a{a[bc}//write a funtion to return false;

5)function Test(){
  for(var i=0; i<10;i++){
    setTimeout[function(){
      console.log(i);
    },0);
  }
}
Test(); //I have told the answer (i.e will display 10 in 10 times) But they have asked me to print the 1 to 10 with same code

5) add(2)(5)(3);//output should be 10  

Write a function that spits out the Fibonacci sequence for any number of digits.

Angular 2 如何实现data binding的6.写Angularjs代码的时候有哪些需要注意的地方

http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2015/07/flex-examples.html


has a few big advantages over JSON-P as well:

It supports HTTP verbs other than GET
Error handling with JSON-P is tricky or impossible. 
CORS has access to the HTTP status and the response body just like XHR does
CORS supports many types of authorization (like Basic Auth or OAuth). JSON-P only supports cookies

The JSONP approach is a workaround that consists of calling an external API  with a DOM <script>  tag. 
The <script> tag is allowed to load content from any domains without security restrictions. 
The targeted API needs to expose a HTTP GET endpoint and return Javascript code instead of the regular JSON data. 
You can use this jQuery code to dynamically call a JSONP URL:

In order to retrieve the API answer from the newly included JavaScript code, jQuery automatically appends a callback argument to your URL (for example &callback=method12 ) which must be called by the JavaScript code that your API generates.

To prevent cross-origin writes, check for an unguessable token in the request, known as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token. You must prevent cross-origin reads of pages that know this token.

Proxied Iframe. This do-it-yourself technique involves including an iframe on your page from the domain you wish to communicate with.  This assumes that you are able to host pages on this other domain.  The JavaScript running in the iframe serves as a rest proxy to the server containing the resources you wish to access.  Communication between your application and the rest proxy will take place using post message.  Post message is part of the HTML5 standard, but there is also a jQuery implementation for non HTML5-compliant browsers.

JSONP. This is a technique that exploits the HTML script element exception to the same-origin security policy.  Script tags can load JavaScript from a different domain and query parameters can be added to the script URI to pass information to the server hosting the script about the resources that you wish to access. The JSONP server will return JavaScript that is evaluated in the browser that calls an agreed upon JavaScript function already on the page to pass server resource data into your page.

the DocumentFragment interface represents a minimal document object that has no parent. It is used as a light-weight version of Document to store a segment of a document structure comprised of nodes just like a standard document. The key difference is that because the document fragment isn't part of the actual DOM's structure, changes made to the fragment don't affect the document, cause reflow, or incur any performance impact that can occur when changes are made.

Build relationship with co-worker.
Disagree with Group decision
Why hire you
Disagree with boss
Can't meet deadline
Could done better
Significant improvmenet ever

I once disagreed with my boss over how to best help a customer. 
Rather than question his authority in front of everyone, I talked to him off of the floor. 
I was open and honest about the problems I had with the way he wanted to do things. 
It turned out that there was just a simple misunderstanding. 
That disagreement we had showed me the importance of communicating with my coworkers to make sure 
that something obsolete doesn’t become a bigger problem than it needs to be.

Remember that hiring managers are looking for someone that will fit in at their company. 
Try and answer in a way that will show your better qualities.

'Conflicting deadlines are a normal occupational hazard. 
I resolve the conflict by using the time frames as the reference, and scheduling for completion according to needs.
I schedule within the deadlines, so I work ahead of them.
I break the jobs into schedules, and complete each job systematically, so I stay organized, and on time. 
It's an effective method of dealing with conflicting deadlines.
In some cases, the deadlines can't be resolved like this. In those cases I ask for guidance from management.'
